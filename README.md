# Smart Voting System through Facial Recognition

This project implements a smart voting system using facial recognition technology. It allows users to register, log in, and vote using their facial features. The backend is built using **Python** and **Flask**, with facial recognition handled by **OpenCV** and **NumPy**. The voting data is stored in a **MySQL** database.
