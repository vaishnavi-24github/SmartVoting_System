# Smart Voting System through Facial Recognition

This project implements a smart voting system using facial recognition technology. It allows users to register, log in, and vote using their facial features. The backend is built using Python and Flask, with the facial recognition handled by OpenCV and NumPy. The voting data is stored in a MySQL database.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by capturing their face image and entering personal details.
- **Facial Recognition Login**: Users can log in by matching their face to the registered database.
- **Voting**: After login, users can cast their vote securely.
- **Voting Results**: The system displays the voting results once voting ends.

---

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (GUI)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MySQL
- GitHub Copilot (for code suggestions)

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **MySQL Database**  
  [Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

- **Required Python Packages**  
  Install the necessary Python packages using `requirements.txt`.

## üîß Install Dependencies

### 1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaishnavi-24github/Smart_Voting_System.git
cd Smart_Voting_System
2. Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
üìÑ Requirements File (requirements.txt)
txt
Copy
Edit
Flask==2.0.3
opencv-python==4.5.5.64
numpy==1.21.2
mysql-connector-python==8.0.26
üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up MySQL Database
1. Create a database in MySQL:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE DATABASE voting_system;
2. Create required tables:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  face_encoding BLOB
);

CREATE TABLE votes (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  vote VARCHAR(100),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
Update the MySQL credentials (username, password, and database) in the app.py file accordingly.

üöÄ Running the Application
Step 1: Start MySQL
Ensure your MySQL server is up and running.

Step 2: Run the Flask App
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

üìù Registration Process
Open the registration page and enter user details (name, email).

Capture the user‚Äôs face using the webcam.

The face encoding is stored in the database.

Run the model training script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python train_models.py
This script trains the facial recognition model with the newly registered face data.

üîê Login Process
Users log in using facial recognition.

The system compares the live camera input to stored face encodings.

On successful match, users proceed to the voting screen.

üó≥Ô∏è Voting Process
After logging in, users select their voting option.

The vote is saved in the database and linked to the user's ID.

üìä Viewing Results
Once voting ends, the system will display voting results fetched from the database.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Face Recognition Issues: Ensure proper lighting and webcam access.

Database Errors: Check credentials and MySQL service status.

Model Training Failures: Ensure sufficient data and system resources.

Missing Dependencies: Re-run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
